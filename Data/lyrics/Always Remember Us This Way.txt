0|That Arizona sky
4|burning in your eyes 
8|you look at me and babe
13|I wanna catch on fire
16|it's buried in my soul 
20|Like California gold
24|you found the light in me 
28|that I couldn't find 

30|so when I'm all choked up 
34|and I can't find the words 
39|Every Time We Say Goodbye 
42|baby, it hurts
45|When the Sun Goes Down 
49|and the band won't play 
53|I'll always remember us this way

60|Lovers In the Night 
64|poets tryna write
68|we don't know how to rhyme 
72|but damn, we try
76|but all I really know
80|you're where I wanna go
85|the part of me that's you
89|will never die

91|so when I'm all choked up 
95|and I can't find the words 
98|Every Time We Say Goodbye 
102|baby, it hurts
105|When the Sun Goes Down 
109|and the band won't play 
113|I'll always remember us this way

149|baby, it hurts
152|When the Sun Goes Down 
156|and the band won't play
