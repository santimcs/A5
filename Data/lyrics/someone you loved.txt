9|I'm going under and this 
12|time I fear there's no one to save me
18|This all or nothing really 
21|got a way of driving me crazy
25|I need somebody to heal 
27|Somebody to know
29|Somebody to have 
31|Somebody to hold
27|It's easy to say 
30|But it's never the same
38|I guess I kinda liked the 
40|way you numbed all the pain
42|Now the day bleeds
44|Into nightfall
47|And you're not here 
49|To get me through it all
51|I let my guard down 
53|And then you pulled the rug
55|I was getting kinda used 
57|to being someone you loved
61|I'm going under and this time I 
64|fear there's no one to turn to
70|This all or nothing way of 
73|loving got me sleeping without you
77|Now, I need somebody to know 
80|Somebody to heal
82|Somebody to have 
84|Just to know how it feels
86|It's easy to say but it's never the same
91|I guess I kinda liked 
93|the way you helped me escape
95|Now the day bleeds 
97|Into nightfall
98|And you're not here 
100|To get me through it all
103|I let my guard down 
105|And then you pulled the rug
107|I was getting kinda used 
110|to being someone you loved
113|And I tend to close 
115|my eyes when it hurts sometimes
119|I fall into your arms
124|I'll be safe in your 
127|sound till I come back around
131|For now the day bleeds
132|Into nightfall
133|And you're not here
135|To get me through it all
138|I let my guard down
140|And then you pulled the rug
142|I was getting kinda used 
144|to being someone you loved
147|But now the day bleeds 
149|Into nightfall
151|And you're not here 
153|To get me through it all
155|I let my guard down 
157|And then you pulled the rug
160|I was getting kinda used 
162|to being someone you loved
165|I let my guard down 
167|And then you pulled the rug
169|I was getting kinda used 
171|to being someone you loved
